MaLTPyNT - Matteo's Libraries and Tools in Python for NuSTAR Timing.
====================================================================

Devel: |Build Status Unstable| |Coverage Status Unstable|

This software is designed to do correctly and fairly easily a
**quick-look timing analysis** of NuSTAR data, treating properly orbital
gaps and exploiting the presence of two independent detectors by using
the **cospectrum** as a proxy for the power density spectrum (for an
explanation of why this is important, look at Bachetti et al., *ApJ*,
800, 109 -`arXiv:1409.3248 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3248>`__). The
output of the analysis is a cospectrum, or a power density spectrum,
that can be fitted with
`Xspec <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/>`__ or
`Isis <http://space.mit.edu/home/mnowak/isis_vs_xspec/mod.html>`__.
Also, one can calculate in the same easy way **time lags** (still under
testing, help is welcome). Despite its main focus on NuSTAR, the
software can be used to make standard spectral analysis on X-ray data
from, in principle, any other satellite (for sure XMM-Newton and RXTE).

MaLTPyNT vs FTOOLS (and together with FTOOLS)
---------------------------------------------

vs POWSPEC
~~~~~~~~~~

MaLTPyNT does a better job than POWSPEC from several points of view:

-  **Good time intervals** (GTIs) are completely avoided in the
   computation. No gaps dirtying up the power spectrum! (This is
   particularly important for NuSTAR, as orbital gaps are always present
   in typical observation timescales)

-  The number of bins used in the power spectrum (or the cospectrum)
   need not be a power of two! No padding needed.

Clarification about dead time treatment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MaLTPyNT **does not supersede**
`nulccorr <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/caldb/help/nulccorr.html>`__.
If one is only interested in frequencies below ~0.5 Hz, nulccorr treats
robustly various dead time components and its use is recommended. Light
curves produced by nulccorr can be converted to MaLTPyNT format using
``MPlcurve --fits-input <lcname>.fits``, and used for the subsequent
steps of the timing analysis.

Acknowledgements
----------------

I would like to thank all the co-authors of `the NuSTAR timing
paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3248>`__ and the NuSTAR X-ray binaries
working group. This software would not exist without the interesting
discussions before and around that paper. In particular, I would like to
thank Ivan Zolotukhin, Francesca Fornasini, Erin Kara, Felix FÃ¼rst,
Poshak Gandhi, John Tomsick and Abdu Zoghbi for helping testing the code
and giving various suggestions on how to improve it. Last but not least,
I would like to thank Marco Buttu (by the way, `check out his book if
you speak
Italian <http://www.amazon.it/Programmare-con-Python-completa-DigitalLifeStyle-ebook/dp/B00L95VURC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1424298092&sr=1-1>`__)
for his priceless pointers on Python coding and code management
techniques.
