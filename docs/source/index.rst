MaLTPyNT documentation
======================

The MaLTPyNT (Matteo's Libraries and Tools in Python for NuSTAR Timing)
suite is designed for the **quick-look timing analysis** of NuSTAR data.
It treats properly orbital gaps (e.g., occultation, SAA passages) and
performs the standard aperiodic timing analysis (power density spectrum, lags,
etc.), plus the **cospectrum**, a proxy for the power density spectrum that uses
the signals from two detectors instead of a single one (for an
explanation of why this is important in NuSTAR, look at Bachetti et al., *ApJ*,
**800**, 109 -`arXiv:1409.3248 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3248>`__).
The output of the analysis, be it a cospectrum, a power density spectrum, or a
lag spectrum, can be fitted with
`Xspec <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/>`__,
`Isis <http://space.mit.edu/home/mnowak/isis_vs_xspec/mod.html>`__ or any other
spectral fitting program.

Despite its main focus on NuSTAR, the software can be used to make standard
spectral analysis on X-ray data
from, in principle, any other satellite (for sure XMM-Newton and RXTE).
Input files can be any event lists in FITS format, provided that they meet
certain minimum standard.
Also, light curves in FITS format or text format can be used. See the
documentation of `MPlcurve` for more information.

Preliminary notes
-----------------

MaLTPyNT vs FTOOLS (and together with FTOOLS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

vs POWSPEC
++++++++++

MaLTPyNT does a better job than POWSPEC from several points of view:

- **Good time intervals** (GTIs) are completely avoided in the
  computation. No gaps dirtying up the power spectrum! (This is
  particularly important for NuSTAR, as orbital gaps are always present
  in typical observation timescales)

- The number of bins used in the power spectrum (or the cospectrum)
  need not be a power of two! No padding needed.

Clarification about dead time treatment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MaLTPyNT **does not supersede**
`nulccorr <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/caldb/help/nulccorr.html>`__.
If one is only interested in frequencies below ~0.5 Hz, nulccorr treats
robustly various dead time components and its use is recommended. Light
curves produced by nulccorr can be converted to MaLTPyNT format using
``MPlcurve --fits-input <lcname>.fits``, and used for the subsequent
steps of the timing analysis.

Acknowledgements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I would like to thank all the co-authors of `the NuSTAR timing
paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3248>`__ and the NuSTAR X-ray binaries
working group. This software would not exist without the interesting
discussions before and around that paper. In particular, I would like to
thank Ivan Zolotukhin, Francesca Fornasini, Erin Kara, Felix FÃ¼rst,
Poshak Gandhi, John Tomsick and Abdu Zoghbi for helping testing the code
and giving various suggestions on how to improve it. Last but not least,
I would like to thank Marco Buttu (by the way, `check out his book if
you speak
Italian <http://www.amazon.it/Programmare-con-Python-completa-DigitalLifeStyle-ebook/dp/B00L95VURC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1424298092&sr=1-1>`__)
for his priceless pointers on Python coding and code management
techniques.
