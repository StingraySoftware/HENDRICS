MaLTPyNT documentation
======================

The MaLTPyNT (Matteo's Libraries and Tools in Python for NuSTAR Timing)
suite is designed for the **quick-look timing analysis** of NuSTAR data.
It treats properly orbital gaps (e.g., occultation, SAA passages) and
performs the standard aperiodic timing analysis (power density spectrum, lags,
etc.), plus the **cospectrum**, a proxy for the power density spectrum that uses
the signals from two detectors instead of a single one (for an
explanation of why this is important in NuSTAR, look at Bachetti et al., *ApJ*,
**800**, 109 -`arXiv:1409.3248 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3248>`__).
The output of the analysis, be it a cospectrum, a power density spectrum, or a
lag spectrum, can be fitted with
`Xspec <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/>`__,
`Isis <http://space.mit.edu/home/mnowak/isis_vs_xspec/mod.html>`__ or any other
spectral fitting program.

Despite its main focus on NuSTAR, the software can be used to make standard
spectral analysis on X-ray data
from, in principle, any other satellite (for sure XMM-Newton and RXTE).
Input files can be any event lists in FITS format, provided that they meet
certain minimum standard.
Also, light curves in FITS format or text format can be used. See the
documentation of `MPlcurve` for more information.

What's new
----------
.. Note ::

    MaLTPyNT provisionally accepted as an
    `Astropy affiliated package <http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`__


In preparation for the 2.0 release, the API has received some visible changes.
Names do not have the `mp_` prefix anymore, as they were very redundant; the
structure of the code base is now based on the AstroPy structure; tests have
been moved and the documentation improved.

`MPexposure` is a new livetime correction script on sub-second timescales for
NuSTAR. It will be able to replace `nulccorr`, and get results on shorter bin
times, in observations done with a specific observing mode, where the observer
has explicitly requested to telemeter all events (including rejected) and the
user has run `nupipeline` with the `CLEANCOLS = NO` option.
This tool is under testing.

`MPfake` is a new script to create fake observation files in FITS format, for
testing. New functions to create fake data will be added to `maltpynt.fake`.

Preliminary notes
-----------------

MaLTPyNT vs FTOOLS (and together with FTOOLS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

vs POWSPEC
++++++++++

MaLTPyNT does a better job than POWSPEC from several points of view:

- **Good time intervals** (GTIs) are completely avoided in the
  computation. No gaps dirtying up the power spectrum! (This is
  particularly important for NuSTAR, as orbital gaps are always present
  in typical observation timescales)

- The number of bins used in the power spectrum (or the cospectrum)
  need not be a power of two! No padding needed.

Clarification about dead time treatment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MaLTPyNT **does not supersede**
`nulccorr <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/caldb/help/nulccorr.html>`__ (yet).
If one is only interested in frequencies below ~0.5 Hz, nulccorr treats
robustly various dead time components and its use is recommended. Light
curves produced by nulccorr can be converted to MaLTPyNT format using
``MPlcurve --fits-input <lcname>.fits``, and used for the subsequent
steps of the timing analysis.

.. Note :: Improved livetime correction in progress!

    In the upcoming release MaLTPyNT 2.0, ``MPexposure`` tries to push the livetime
    correction to timescales below 1 s, allowing livetime-corrected timing
    analysis above 1 Hz. The feature is under testing
