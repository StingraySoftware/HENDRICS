Quick-look analysis
-------------------

Preliminary info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial assumes that you have previous knowledge of timing
techniques, so that I don't repeat concepts as Nyquist frequency, the
importance of choosing carefully the binning time and the FFT length,
and so on. If you are not familiar with these concepts, `this paper by
Michiel is a very good place to
start <http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/47104>`__. Why in the example below
I use the cospectrum instead of the PDS, is written in our `timing
paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3248>`__.

This software has a modular structure. One starts from cleaned event
files (such as those produced by tools like ``nupipeline`` and possibly
barycentered with ``barycorr`` or equivalent), and produces a series of
products with subsequent steps:

1. **event lists** containing event arrival times and PI channel
   information

2. (optional) **calibrated event lists**, where PI values have been
   converted to energy

3. **light curves**, choosing the energy band and the bin time

4. (optional) **summed light curves** if we want to join events from
   multiple instruments, or just from different observing times

5. **power spectrum** and/or **cross spectrum** (hereafter the
   \`\`frequency spectra'')

6. **rebinning** of frequency spectra

7. finally, **lags** and **cospectrum**

8. (optional) frequency spectra in XSpec format

Most of these tools have help information that can be accessed by typing
the name of the command plus -h or --help:

::

    $ MPcalibrate -h
    usage: MPcalibrate [-h] [-r RMF] [-o] files [files ...]

    Calibrates clean event files by associating the correct energy to each PI
    channel. Uses either a specified rmf file or (for NuSTAR only) an rmf file
    from the CALDB

    positional arguments:
      files              List of files

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      -r RMF, --rmf RMF  rmf file used for calibration
      -o, --overwrite    Overwrite; default: no

Some scripts (e.g. ``MPreadevents``, ``MPlcurve``, ``MPfspec``) have a
``--nproc`` option, useful when one needs to treat multiple files at a
time. The load is divided among ``nproc`` processors, that work in
parallel cutting down considerably the execution time.

For I/O, MaLTPyNT looks if the ``netCDF4`` library is installed. If it's
found in the system, files will be saved in this format. Otherwise, the
native Python ``pickle`` format format will be used. This format is
*much* slower (It might take some minutes to load some files) and files
will be bigger, but this possibility ensures portability. If you don't
use netCDF4, you'll notice that file names will have the ``.p``
extension instead of the ``.nc`` below. The rest is the same.

Loading event lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from cleaned event files, we will first save them in
``MaLTPyNT`` format (a ``pickle`` or ``netcdf4`` file). For example, I'm starting
from two event lists called ``002A.evt`` and ``002B.evt``, containing
the cleaned event lists from a source observed with NuSTAR's ``FPMA``
and ``FPMB`` respectively.

::

    $ MPreadevents 002A.evt 002B.evt
    Opening 002A.evt
    Saving events and info to 002A_ev.nc
    Opening 002B.evt
    Saving events and info to 002B_ev.nc

This will create new files with a ``_ev.nc`` extension (``_ev.p`` if you
don't use netCDF4), containing the event times and the energy *channel*
(``PI``) of each event

Calibrating event lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``MPcalibrate``. You can either specify an ``rmf`` file with the
``-r`` option, or just let it look for it in the NuSTAR ``CALDB`` (the
environment variable has to be defined!)

::

    $ MPcalibrate 002A_ev.nc 002B_ev.nc
    Loading file 002A_ev.nc...
    Done.
    ###############ATTENTION!!#####################

    Rmf not specified. Using default NuSTAR rmf.

    ###############################################
    Saving calibrated data to 002A_ev_calib.nc
    Loading file 002B_ev.nc...
    Done.
    ###############ATTENTION!!#####################

    Rmf not specified. Using default NuSTAR rmf.

    ###############################################
    Saving calibrated data to 002B_ev_calib.nc

This will create two new files with ``_ev_calib.nc`` suffix that will
contain energy information. Optionally, you can overwrite the original
event lists.


Producing light curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose carefully the binning
time (option ``-b``). Since what we are interested in is a power
spectrum, this binning time will limit our maximum frequency in the
power spectrum. We are here specifying 2^-8 =0.00390625 for binning time
(how to use the ``-b`` option is of course documented. Use ``-h`` FMI).
Since we have calibrated the event files, we can also choose an event
energy range, here between 3 and 30 keV. Another thing that is useful in
NuSTAR data is taking some time intervals out from the start and the end
of each GTI. This is mostly to eliminate an increase of background level
that often appears at GTI borders and produces very nasty power spectral
shapes. Here I filter 100 s from the start and 300 s from the end of
each GTI.

::

    $ MPlcurve 002A_ev_calib.nc 002B_ev_calib.nc -b -8 -e 3 30 --safe-interval 100 300
    Loading file 002A_ev_calib.nc...
    Done.
    Saving light curve to 002A_E3-30_lc.nc
    Loading file 002B_ev_calib.nc...
    Done.
    Saving light curve to 002B_E3-30_lc.nc

To check the light curve that was produced, use the ``MPplot`` program:

::

    $ MPplot 002A_E3-30_lc.nc

``MPlcurve`` also accepts light curves in FITS and text format. FITS light curves
should be produced by the ``lcurve`` FTOOL or similar, while the text light
curves should have
two columns: time from the NuSTAR MJDREF (55197.00076601852) and intensity in
counts/bin.
Use
::

    $ MPlcurve --fits-input lcurve.fits

or

::

    $ MPlcurve --txt-input lcurve.txt

respectively.

Joining, summing and "scrunching" light curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we want a single light curve from multiple ones, either summing
multiple instruments or multiple energy or time ranges, we can use
``MPscrunchlc``:

::

    $ MPscrunchlc 002A_E3-30_lc.nc 002B_E3-30_lc.nc -o 002scrunch_3-30_lc.nc
    Loading file 002A_E3-30_lc.nc...
    Done.
    Loading file 002B_E3-30_lc.nc...
    Done.
    Saving joined light curve to out_lc.nc
    Saving scrunched light curve to 002scrunch_3-30_lc.nc

This is only tested in \`\`safe'' situations (files are not too big and
have consistent time and energy ranges), so it might give inconsistent
results or crash in untested situations. Please report any problems!

Producing power spectra and cross power spectra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us just produce the cross power spectrum for now. To produce also
the power spectra corresponding to each light curve, substitute
``"CPDS"`` with ``"PDS,CPDS"``. I use rms normalization here, default
would be Leahy normalization.

::

    $ MPfspec 002A_E3-30_lc.nc 002B_E3-30_lc.nc -k CPDS -o cpds_002_3-30 --norm rms
    Beware! For cpds and derivatives, I assume that the files are
    ordered as follows: obs1_FPMA, obs1_FPMB, obs2_FPMA, obs2_FPMB...
    Loading file 002A_E3-30_lc.nc...
    Loading file 002B_E3-30_lc.nc...
    Saving CPDS to ./cpds_002_3-30_0.nc

Rebinning the spectrum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's rebin the spectrum. If the rebin factor is an integer, it is
interpreted as a constant rebinning. Otherwise (only if >1), it is
interpreted as a geometric binning.

::

    $ MPrebin cpds_002_3-30_0.nc -r 1.03
    Saving cpds to cpds_002_3-30_0_rebin1.03.nc

Calculating the cospectrum and phase/time lags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calculation of lags and their errors is implemented in ``MPlags``,
and needs to be tested properly. For the cospectrum, it is sufficient to
read the real part of the cross power spectrum as depicted in the
relevant function in ``plot.py`` (`Use the source,
Luke! <http://adastraerrans.com/archivos/use-the-source-luke.png>`__).

Saving the spectra in a format readable to XSpec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To save the cospectrum in a format readable to XSpec it is sufficient to
give the command

::

    $ MP2xspec cpds_002_3-30_0_rebin1.03.nc --flx2xsp

Open and fit in XSpec!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ xspec
    XSPEC> data cpds.pha
    XSPEC> cpd /xw; setp ener; setp comm log y
    XSPEC> mo lore + lore + lore
    (...)
    XSPEC> fit
    XSPEC> pl eufspe delchi

etc. |screenshot.png|

(NOTE: `I know, Mike, it's unfolded... but for a flat response it
shouldn't matter,
right? <http://space.mit.edu/home/mnowak/isis_vs_xspec/plots.html>`__ ;)

Data simulation
---------------

To simulate datasets, `MaLTPyNT` includes the `MPfake` script. It can simulate
event lists with a fixed count rate or from an input light curve. Also, it is able
to apply a dead time filter to the simulated event lists.

Basic operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To simulate a short observation (1025 s) at a given count rate (e.g., 150 ct/s),
it is sufficient to call `MPfake -c <countrate>`

::

    $ MPfake -c 150
    $ ls
    events.evt

To simulate an event list from an input light curve, use the `-l` (or `--lc`)
option. The light curve can be in FITS or MaLTPyNT native format (or one can use
MPlcurve for the conversion from text format):

::

    $ MPfake -l lightcurve.fits

To apply dead time to the generated events, use the `--deadtime` option. deadtime
can be supplied as a single number, meaning a constant dead time

::

    $ MPfake -l lightcurve.fits --deadtime 2.5e-3

or as two numbers (`mean`, `sigma`), meaning a Gaussian distribution of dead
times with the specified mean and sigma.

More advanced options are available using the functions in `maltpynt.fake`.
